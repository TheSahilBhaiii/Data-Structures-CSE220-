Given an array A of N elements. Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an
array A of size N is an element that appears more than N/2 times in the array.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
A = [1,2,3]
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Since, each element in
[1,2,3] appears only once so there
is no majority element.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 5
A = [3,1,3,3,2]
Output:
3
Explanation:
Since, 3 is present more
than N/2 times, so it is
the majority element.


Solution:
basically used dupplicate checker here


         for(int i=0;i<N;i++){
                for(int j=i+1;j<N;j++){
                    if(arr[i]==arr[j]){
                        counter++;
                        continue;
                    }
                    else{
                        continue;
                    }
                }
            }
