Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, find a continuous
sub-array which adds to a given number S.
In case of multiple subarrays, return the subarray which comes first on moving from left to right.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, S = 12
A = [1,2,3,7,5]
Output: 2 4
Explanation: The sum of elements
from 2nd position to 4th position
is 12.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 10, S = 15
A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Output: 1 5
Explanation: The sum of elements
from 1st position to 5th position
is 15.


Solution:
adding until we get close to the value given S
3 cases:
1. if sum<S then we will add array element to the sum and endcounter will be i+1
2. if sum==S then we wil break the loop 
3. if sum>S then we will reset the first counter and minus the first value from the array
